Welcome to the world of Zeek! This guide is for folks who want to learn about Zeek or implement it into their system. I'll walk you through installation, basic setup, and running your first Zeek script.

## Installing Zeek from Source in Ubuntu

For other Linux variants, check the [official documentation](https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/install.html).

First, install the dependencies:

```bash
sudo apt-get install cmake make gcc g++ flex bison libpcap-dev libssl-dev python3 python3-dev swig zlib1g-dev
```

Clone the Repository:

```bash
git clone --recursive https://github.com/zeek/zeek
```

Build from Source:

```bash
./configure
make
make install
```

By default, the installation is in `/usr/local/zeek/` which requires root privileges during `make install`. You can use the `--prefix` option to install in other directories. For example, to install in the `.local` folder in your home directory:

```bash
./configure --prefix=/home/yourusername/.local
```

The configuration and installation process might take a while. If you can run `zeek --help`, then you've installed it successfully.

## Installing via Pre-built Binary Source Packages

You can download packages from the [official repository](https://software.opensuse.org/download.html?project=security%3Azeek&package=zeek) according to your OS. For Ubuntu 22.04:

```bash
echo 'deb http://download.opensuse.org/repositories/security:/zeek/xUbuntu_22.04/ /' | sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/security:zeek.list
curl -fsSL https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/security:zeek/xUbuntu_22.04/Release.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/trusted.gpg.d/security_zeek.gpg > /dev/null
sudo apt update
sudo apt install zeek
```

## Configuring the Runtime Environment

Export the installation path:

```bash
export PATH=/usr/local/zeek/bin:$PATH
```

## Running Your First Script

Create your first Zeek script with this simple "Hello World" example:

```zeek
event zeek_init() {
    print "Hello, World!";
}

event zeek_done() {
    print "Goodbye, World!";
}
```

Save this as `hello.zeek` and run it:

```bash
zeek hello.zeek
```

## Capturing and Analyzing Network Traffic

Let's capture some packets and analyze them with Zeek. First, capture some traffic:

```bash
sudo tcpdump -s 0 -w get.trace
```

Run this for about 5 minutes, then press Ctrl+C to stop.

Now create a script to record log files (save as `main.zeek`):

```zeek
event zeek_init() {
    Log::create_stream(Conn::LOG, [$columns=Conn::Info, $path="Conn"]);
    local filter: Log::Filter = [$name="conn", $path="conn"];
    Log::add_filter(Conn::LOG, filter);
    Log::remove_filter(Conn::LOG, "default");
}
```

Analyze the captured traffic:

```bash
zeek -C -r get.trace main.zeek
```

This will generate several log files including `conn.log`, `dns.log`, `reporter.log`, `ssl.log`, and `weird.log`. These logs can be inspected for suspicious activity and further analysis.

Happy Zeeking!
